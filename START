# title:        Working with SASS
# description:  Discourse uses a CSS preprocessor called SASS, which you'll need
#               to have a passing familiarity with to start working with
#               Discourse CSS. For the purposes of this course, the minimum you
#               need is to watch the youtube video, and read the guide, linked
#               in the references below. If you like to understand something
#               in more depth before using it, take one of the courses listed
#               in the Hackr.io link below.
